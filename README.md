My name is Cyrehn Jeward Baltazar and fresh out of SISC 2023.
I'm super pumped to keep learning! I'm especially interested in software and fullstack development. 
I'm looking to put my skills to the test in a real job and keep growing as a developer. 
I've been working on some cool projects to show what I've learned so far, and I'll be sharing them soon.
